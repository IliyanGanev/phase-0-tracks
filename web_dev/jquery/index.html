	<p>San Francisco's vibrant street and public art scene draws tourists from around the world. Murals, sculptures, and hidden gems abound, and there are numerous tour offerings that promise to show you the best of what the city has to offer. A main controversy surrounding street art in the Bay Area is that it is a major sign of "social disorder. Street art in San Francisco is considered controversial because it vandalizes public spaces, while also providing art that people like to look at.  </p>

	<p>One of the sites I like is  <a href="https://appwebagency.it" target="_blank">www.appagency.it</a> I like their minimalist approach. In addition to the simple design the character they created makes the interaction with the site more appealing and humanlike. What I don't like is that there is no portfolio or list of clients. I guess this will be corrected soon, since they have been nominated for several awwwards.</p>
