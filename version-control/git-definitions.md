# Git Definitions with minor changes.

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

	Version control is something that allows us to view the entire history of revisions. It is useful because many people can work and contribute to the same project and go back in history to make changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

	A branch is a good way to work on features that can be merged to the master branch or other branches. One reason to use it is beacause it's safer than working directly with the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

	A commit records a change to the repository. A good commit message describes the intent for the changes that were made. It is good practice to use present tense.

* What is a merge conflict?

	It is something that happens when there are disagreeing changes when merging branches.
