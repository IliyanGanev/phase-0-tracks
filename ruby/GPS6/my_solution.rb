 #Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Leonard Dain].
# We spent [1] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# Requre relative tells the file to refer to another file within the same directory if no path is specified.

require_relative 'state_data'

# Reflection Section

#What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
#One uses a strings as  keys. The other symbols as keys.The difference is that symbols are immutable(They cannot be changed after assignment)

#What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
#One way is to use each. Another way is to use map if we want to madify some values.

#When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
#What stood out is that instance variables are available within the class.

#What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
#I solidified the concepts of scope of instance variables and private methods as well as when require and require_relative are used.
