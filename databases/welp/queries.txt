Realease 2.

2.You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM users Join reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id; 
1|Bradford|Pitt|1|4|good chapel|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow WEdding Chapel
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|5|very fast towing|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
3|Angela|Jolie|3|2|noisy night club|3|3|3|The Beagle Nightclub
4|Steven|Wonder|4|5|good grand piano|3|4|3|The Beagle Nightclub
sqlite> 

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses Join reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|Grundy Hollow WEdding Chapel|1|4|good chapel|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|Amir's Towing|2|5|very fast towing|2|2|2|Mandy|Kaling
3|The Beagle Nightclub|3|2|noisy night club|3|3|3|Angela|Jolie
3|The Beagle Nightclub|4|5|good grand piano|3|4|4|Steven|Wonder
sqlite> 



3.There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users Join reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow WEdding Chapel|4|good chapel
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|5|very fast towing
Angela|Jolie|The Beagle Nightclub|2|noisy night club
Steven|Wonder|The Beagle Nightclub|5|good grand piano
sqlite> 


4.How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM users Join reviews ON users.id  = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id  WHERE businesses.name = "The Beagle Nightclub";
3|Angela|Jolie|3|2|noisy night club|3|3|3|The Beagle Nightclub
4|Steven|Wonder|4|5|good grand piano|3|4|3|The Beagle Nightclub
sqlite>
